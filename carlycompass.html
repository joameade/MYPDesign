                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Compass is a type of tool desgined to help people know the directions, before the design of the compass, people used to use the sun, moon, stars as the compass.
                        But the problem is that if there is fog or in a unfamilier area or in the ocean, it will be dificult to identify the direction.
                    </h3>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Its posible that during the time of the Xia Dynasty (2070â€“1600 BC) compass where already desgined. 
                        It recorded that the emperor defeated an enemy army by using a southward-pointing cart which is a compass that helped him know their position
                         so that he could lead his army to fight the enemies during a major battle near Beijing in the fog.
